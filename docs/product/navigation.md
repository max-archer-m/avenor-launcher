# Navigation and Surface Model

> Public semantic source: English. Chinese counterpart: [navigation.zh-CN.md](navigation.zh-CN.md).

## Responsibility

This document defines the current relationship, entry, exit, restoration, and shared transition behavior of Home, Drawer, Settings, and the application action sheet. It does not prescribe whether Home and Drawer are implemented as separate composable destinations or as coordinated regions of one implementation surface.

## Initial surface

- Home is the initial surface whenever the Launcher starts or restores after process recreation.
- Home and Drawer are distinct product surfaces even if implementation later uses one draggable container.
- Settings is reachable only by selecting the fixed Settings row in the final Drawer section. The Settings gear at the bottom of the AlphabetIndex navigates to that section and does not open Settings directly.
- Home has no Settings entry.

## Transition model

Home and Drawer use one reversible direct-manipulation transition. The following terms define its observable behavior:

- **Gesture displacement:** The accumulated drag distance in the direction of the target surface. Opposite movement reduces the accumulated distance toward zero.
- **Gesture progress:** Gesture displacement divided by 200dp, clamped to the range from 0 to 1. The 200dp value is the current full gesture distance and may be reconsidered through a later product change.
- **Interactive Drawer displacement:** While the pointer remains down, Drawer moves 1.5dp for each 1dp of gesture displacement. This 1:1.5 mapping applies in both directions.
- **Surface travel:** Drawer travels between its off-screen position below the viewport and its final position at the top of the viewport. The 200dp gesture distance does not mean that the viewport is 300dp high.
- **Settle animation:** After the release decision, the system animates the remaining screen distance from the current interactive position to the selected endpoint. The user is never required to drag Drawer across the full physical screen height.

### Opacity

Opacity is derived from gesture progress, not from Drawer screen-travel percentage. For gesture progress `p`:

- Home content opacity is `max(0, 1 - 2p)`.
- Drawer content opacity is `min(1, 2p)`.
- At 0% progress, Home is fully visible and Drawer is transparent.
- At 25% progress, both surfaces have 50% content opacity.
- At 50% progress, Home is transparent and Drawer is fully visible.
- From 50% through 100%, Home remains transparent and Drawer remains fully visible while position continues to change.

The reverse transition uses the same values in reverse. Rebound and completion animations continue from the current position and opacity without a jump.

### Release decision

- Reaching or exceeding 60% gesture progress, equivalent to 120dp, completes the transition to the target surface.
- Releasing below 60% returns to the origin surface unless the release constitutes a fling in the target direction.
- A target-directed fling completes the transition even below 60%. The velocity threshold and detector are implementation details that must preserve this observable result.
- A fling in the opposite direction does not complete toward the target; it returns toward the origin.
- Cancellation or system interruption returns to the origin through the same position and opacity path.
- Additional pointers have no product action. They must not cause a position jump, reverse the transition, activate an application, or create a second simultaneous transition.

## Home to Drawer

- In normal Home mode, an upward drag is the only user-gesture entry into ordinary Drawer. A Home edit-mode add-favorite entry may programmatically complete the same upward transition into Drawer favorite multi-selection mode; this does not enable Home-to-Drawer dragging during edit mode.
- In normal Home mode, the drag may begin anywhere inside Avenor's Home interaction area, including over the time, date, favorite entries, empty state, loading state, error state, and Retry control. System-reserved inset gestures remain governed by Android.
- Vertical upward movement first scrolls the favorite main list toward its end. If the main list cannot consume displacement, its remaining displacement transfers from the same continuous gesture into the Home-to-Drawer transition without requiring the user to lift. Transition progress begins from the transferred displacement, not distance already consumed by list scrolling.
- Downward dragging scrolls the favorite main list toward its start and does not initiate a Home surface transition. A horizontal favorite ribbon consumes a gesture only after horizontal intent is established.
- Home-to-Drawer dragging is disabled while Home edit mode is active. A whole-application-item long press recognized while the style settings panel is collapsed, or a whole-module long press recognized while it is expanded, owns its corresponding movement; other vertical drags scroll the favorite main list.
- A pointer sequence can resolve to only one Home action. Before an interactive element's selection or long-press action has been committed, recognition of an upward drag transfers ownership to the Home-to-Drawer transition and suppresses that element's selection, long-press, and haptic response.
- In eligible basic-information blank space, two taps may resolve to the lock gesture defined in [double-tap-lock.md](features/double-tap-lock.md). Any drag that takes transition ownership cancels that recognition. Time, date-and-weekday, favorites, and other interactive targets never participate in double-tap locking.
- Selection is committed only when the pointer is released without the sequence becoming an upward drag or a long-press. Once a long-press has been recognized and its action has opened, the same pointer sequence does not also begin the Drawer transition.
- A cancelled sequence performs no selection or long-press action and follows the transition cancellation behavior when a Home-to-Drawer drag had already taken ownership.

## Drawer to Home

- System Back returns Drawer to Home using the completion path of the reverse transition.
- Drawer's ordinary-mode top-app-bar Back arrow returns to Home through that same completion path.
- Downward dragging first scrolls the application list toward its top boundary.
- While list scroll offset is greater than zero, the list exclusively consumes downward displacement and Drawer does not begin to leave.
- When the list reaches offset zero during the same continuous gesture, remaining downward displacement transfers immediately into the Drawer-to-Home transition; the user does not need to lift and drag again.
- Once the surface transition owns the remaining gesture, the list stays at its top boundary until the transition settles.

## Back and restoration

- On Home, Back has no visible effect when Avenor is the system default Launcher. When Avenor is not the default Launcher, Avenor performs ordinary system Back behavior and does not prescribe the external destination.
- On Drawer, Back returns to Home.
- On Settings, Back returns to the previous Avenor surface, currently Drawer.
- On the application action sheet, Back dismisses the sheet and returns to the unchanged underlying surface.
- In Home edit mode, Back first collapses an expanded style settings panel; otherwise it exits to normal Home. In Drawer favorite multi-selection mode, Back first cancels the complete unconfirmed selection and returns through the reverse transition to Home edit mode; it does not also exit edit mode.
- Process restoration begins at Home. Drawer, Settings, an action sheet, edit mode, and transient panel or selection state are not restored. Within the same process, ordinary Avenor round trips preserve the favorite main list's meaningful vertical position and each ribbon's meaningful horizontal position. Process recreation resets them to their content starts.

## Home edit-mode interruption

- Home edit mode remains valid only while Home is the fully foreground, interactive Avenor surface. A system or external interruption that covers Home input or moves interaction away from Home exits edit mode, including opening the notification shade or Quick Settings, showing Recents, locking or turning off the screen, opening another application, or presenting another system-owned surface.
- The interruption cancels any in-progress gesture or unpublished application or module movement, collapses the style settings panel, clears module selection, and dismisses edit-only visual feedback. Successfully saved changes remain. An atomic mutation whose save already started follows its existing completion or failure rule, but neither result may restore edit mode. If Avenor can observe the interruption result only when Home becomes interactive again, it must complete this reset before accepting new Home input. Dismissing the interruption therefore reveals normal Home, never the previous application- or module-level edit state.
- Avenor-owned steps that belong to the same editing journey are not external interruptions: expanding or collapsing the inline style settings panel, showing an Avenor confirmation or removal Snackbar, and entering or returning from Drawer favorite multi-selection follow their own documented state rules.

## Android system Home action and external application return

- When Avenor is the selected default Launcher, the Android system Home action from any Avenor surface, including Home edit mode, Drawer, Drawer favorite multi-selection mode, and Settings, displays normal Avenor Home. An active favorite multi-selection is cancelled and edit mode is exited. Within the same process, normal Home retains the latest meaningful main-list and ribbon positions formed by successfully completed scrolling or editing; cancelling an unfinished gesture does not create a new position. This is a system navigation result, not an Avenor Back or Drawer-to-Home transition, and Avenor does not reinterpret the Android system Home action as Back. Unqualified `Home` in this contract means the Avenor product surface, never this platform action.
- Launching an ordinary application from Home or Drawer creates an external application excursion. When Avenor returns in the same process, it displays Home rather than restoring Drawer, and it does not show Loading or require a new blocking initial read before showing the existing Home content.
- The same-process return preserves Home favorite state, the main list's meaningful vertical position, and each ribbon's meaningful horizontal position. It does not restore Drawer, Settings, an action sheet, edit mode, or an in-progress Drawer position.
- Changes observed while the external application is active are reconciled without replacing the returning Home surface with Loading. The updated inventory and favorite state are available the next time Drawer or the relevant Home content is presented, subject to the live-update rules of those surfaces.
- If the Launcher process was recreated while the external application was active, the process-restoration rules apply instead of the same-process return rules.

## System surfaces

- Home and Drawer show the system status bar.
- Home preserves its transparent application surface. Drawer's application background follows its selected background mode and remains outside this navigation contract.
- Home and Drawer request transparent status-bar and navigation-bar regions and draw edge to edge beneath them. Avenor does not add an independent opaque system-bar background; the applicable Home or Drawer surface treatment remains governed by its presentation specification.
- Avenor leaves platform and device contrast enforcement at its default behavior. A system-provided translucent protection, including protection used by three-button navigation on applicable Android versions, is not replaced or forcibly disabled by Avenor.
- The system navigation bar and controls follow the user's current navigation mode. Avenor does not hide them or enter immersive mode.
- Home, Drawer, Settings, and every action sheet use the dark theme with light foreground elements. Opening a sheet must not switch system status-bar icons to a dark appearance.
- Content and interaction targets must respect system-bar, display-cutout, and gesture insets even though Home and Drawer draw edge to edge behind transparent system bars.

## Acceptance intent

- A 100dp drag produces 50% gesture progress and 150dp of interactive Drawer displacement before endpoint settling.
- Releasing at 119dp without a qualifying fling returns to the origin; releasing at 120dp or beyond completes to the target.
- A qualifying target-directed fling below 120dp completes to the target.
- Position and opacity remain continuous when the user reverses direction, releases, completes, or rebounds. Drawer-to-Home remains continuous when a gesture transfers from Drawer list scrolling.
- In normal Home mode, an upward drag can begin over every Avenor-managed Home element without also activating or long-pressing that element.
- Drawer cannot be dismissed by a downward list gesture until its list has reached the top boundary; remaining displacement then transfers in the same gesture.
- Opening or closing Drawer does not accidentally launch, long-press, or scroll an application entry.
- With Avenor selected as the default Launcher, the Android system Home action from Drawer and Settings displays Home; it does not depend on the Avenor Back action.
- Returning from an ordinary application in the same process displays Home without Loading and without restoring Drawer.
- Returning from a system or external interruption never restores Home edit mode, its expanded style settings panel, module selection, or an unpublished movement.
- The implementation may choose any architecture that satisfies these observable behaviors.
